      Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people from
      outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account and sign in with their own work,
      school, or social identities. Guest users allow you to share your company's applications and
      services with users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data.

      Work with external partners, large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department.
      A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials to access your
      company's resources as a guest user.

      Guest users in every subscription should be review on a regular basis to ensure that inactive and
      unneeded accounts are removed.

      Guest users in the Azure AD are generally required for collaboration purposes in Office 365, and
      may also be required for Azure functions in enterprises with multiple Azure tenants. Guest users
      are typically added outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially
      be overlooked indefinitely, leading to a potential vulnerability. To prevent this, guest users should
      be reviewed on a regular basis. During this audit, guest users should also be determined to not have
      administrative privileges.

      The Azure platform allows a SQL server to be created as a service.

    :title: Ensure FTP deployments are Disabled
    :desc: |-
      By default, Azure Functions, Web, and API Services can be deployed over FTP. If FTP is
      required for an essential deployment workflow, FTPS should be required for FTP login for
      all App Service Apps and Functions.

      RATIONALE: Azure FTP deployment endpoints are public. An attacker listening to traffic on
      a wifi network used by a remote employee or a corporate network could see login traffic in
      clear-text which would then grant them full control of the code base of the app or service.
      This finding is more severe if User Credentials for deployment are set at the subscription
      level rather than using the default Application Credentials which are unique per App.
